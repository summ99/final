        <div class="what1">
          <p>A mukbang, also spelled meokbang, translates to 'eating show'. It is an online audiovisual broadcast in which a host consumes large quantities of food while interacting with the audience. It became popular in South Korea in 2010, and since then it has become a worldwide trend.</p>

        <h4>Why did people start watching and/or doing mukbangs?</h4>

        <div class="why">
          <div class="whyDescrip">
          <img class = "whyPic" src="solo.png">
            <p>Solomangarephobia - the fear of eating alone in public. More people in Korea are
              living alone at home.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="whyDescrip">
          <img class = "whyPic" src="feast.png">
            <p>Food Porn - The spread is always visually stimulating. ASMR videos appeal to those who enjoy hearing the texture and sounds during a meal.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="whyDescrip">
          <img class = "whyPic" src="moon.png">
            <p>Dieters - Satisfaction from food visuals and quantities. Some viewers suppress their appetites by watching others eat what they want.</p>

        <h4>Why are there issues with mukbangs?</h4>

        <div class="how">
          <div class="howDescrip">
            <p>Rewards - Mukbangers create experiences for the fulfillment of their communities and themselves. The audience is deeply engaged and 'thanks' the host by upvoting,
            sharing, or sending 'gifts' that can be redeemed for monetary payment on livestreaming platforms. Youtube mukbangs are paid according to views.</p>
